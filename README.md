# Project-Analytics-Revenue-Performance-in-Commercial-Company
<br>
This repository is mainly for projects I have done under Mindx's Data Analyst course.
This program prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib), SQL, and Power BI as I build a portfolio of projects.

<h3>Project Analytics Revenue Performance in Commercial Company by Power BI and Python programming.</h3><br>
<h5>I. Overview: </h5>
<br>
The sales situation of the company tends to increase over the past 4 years, especially in 2013, and 2014. Areas with high revenue and the highest profit are concentrated in New York and Los Angeles.
<bt>
The profit-to-revenue ratio of the company over 4 years is 12.5%, this rate is relatively low. The company needs to implement policies to save costs and increase sales.
Some negative profits due to the company trading in a number of items with negative profitability in some item need to review in the policy.
<br>
Market overview spans 531 cities but there are only 793 customers and 9994 orders in total over 4 years, this number of customers is relatively small compared to the breadth of the market, it is necessary to review the customer return index customers or the number of customers in each city to find out the reason for the policy adjustment.

<h5>II. Ask to explore: </h5>
<br>
Issue:
<br>
1. Why profit is negative, how does the product fluctuate? <br>
2. Why is the number of customers relatively limited? <br>
