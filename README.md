# Project-Analytics-Revenue-Performance-in-Commercial-Company
<br>
This repository is mainly for projects I have done under Mindx's Data Analyst course.
This program prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib), SQL, and Power BI as I build a portfolio of projects.
